= Getting started

This guide will help you to get started to use this component to configure cluster-scoped operator subscriptions.

== Prerequisites

* You have an OpenShift 4 cluster on which you want to configure a cluster-scoped operator subscription from a Commodore component
* You are able to compile the cluster catalog locally

== Steps

[TIP]
====
We recommend creating an empty directory and following these steps after changing to that directory.

[source,bash]
----
work_dir=$(mktemp -d)
pushd "${work_dir}"
----
====

. Make a note of the cluster and tenant IDs
+
[source,bash]
----
export CLUSTER_ID=c-the-cluster-1234 <1>
export TENANT_ID=t-the-tenant-1234 <2>
----
<1> Replace `c-the-cluster-1234` with the ID of your cluster
<2> Replace `t-the-tenant-1234` with the ID of your cluster's tenant

. Compile the cluster catalog so you can make changes locally
+
[source,bash]
----
commodore catalog compile "${CLUSTER_ID}"
----

. Determine whether you want to deploy the operator into namespace `openshift-operators` or `openshift-operators-redhat`.
+
[source,bash]
----
export INSTANCE="openshift-operators" <1>
----
<1> Generally, community operators should be deployed in `openshift-operators`, while official RedHat operators should be deployed in `openshift-operators-redhat`.
If you're not sure, it's best to choose `openshift-operators`.

. Ensure the component is instantiated correctly for the cluster.
+
[source,bash]
----
if [ ! -f "inventory/targets/${INSTANCE}.yml" ]; then
  yq eval -i ".applications += [\"openshift4-operators as ${INSTANCE}\"]" \
    "inventory/classes/${TENANT_ID}/${CLUSTER_ID}.yml" <1>
  (cd "inventory/classes/${TENANT_ID}"; git commit -av; git push origin master) <2>
fi
----
<1> Configure component instance
<2> Commit and push cluster configuration change

. Now you can create a cluster-scoped operator subscription in your component's Jsonnet code
+
[source,jsonnet]
----
local operatorlib = import 'lib/openshift4-operators.libsonnet';

{
  subscription: operatorlib.registerSubscription(
    'openshift-operators', <1>
    'grafana-operator', <2>
    'alpha', <3>
    source='community-operators', <4>
    installPlanApproval='Automatic', <5>
    sourceNamespace='openshift-marketplace', <6>
  )
}
----
<1> The namespace in which the subscription should be created.
Use the same value as you've selected for `${INSTANCE}` in the 3rd step.
<2> The name of the subscription
<3> The update channel for the subscription
<4> The `CatalogSource` for the subscription.
For community operators, set this to `community-operators`.
For RedHat operators, this parameter can be omitted, as it defaults to `redhat-operators`.
<5> Whether installation and upgrades happen automatically.
In most cases, you don't have to specify this parameter.
If the parameter is omitted, it defaults to `Automatic`.
<6> The namespace in which to look for the `CatalogSource`.
In most cases, you don't have to specify this parameter.
If the parameter is omitted, it defaults to `openshift-marketplace`.

. Compile the catalog locally to check your changes
+
[source,bash]
----
commodore catalog compile "${CLUSTER_ID}" --local
----
+
You should see the following YAML added to your component's catalog directory
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  annotations: {}
  labels:
    name: grafana-operator
  name: grafana-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel: alpha
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: grafana-operator
  source: community-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
----
+
If the component hasn't previously been instantiated for `openshift-operators`, you'll also see new YAML files in the catalog in directory `openshift4-operators`.
